# UBC Employee Salary


I wanted to make use of the information made available by UBC to try and understand salary distribution.




**DISCLAIMER**: I made an initial version of this projectr in 2020 when I just scraped the 2020 financial report. Recently I have been practising working with Tableau and though this would be a good project to do it. So I extended my initial code to also scrape later years. However, I found another similar project which scraped the UBC 2023 financial report. Here is a link to their repo: https://github.com/jjadeb/UBCSalary and a link to their Tableau visualisation: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jade.bouchard/viz/Test-UBCSalaries/Dashboard1. They were also able to get information on the persons title and department which would be a great way to extend the enalysis.
